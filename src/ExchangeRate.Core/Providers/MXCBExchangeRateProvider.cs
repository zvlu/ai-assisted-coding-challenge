    /// - The Mexican central bank publishes MONTHLY USD-MXN rates
    /// - But business requirements need DAILY MXN-EUR rates
    /// - These must be calculated using cross-rates:
    ///   MXN-EUR = 1 / (EUR-USD_daily * USD-MXN_monthly)
    ///
    /// Example calculation:
    ///   If EUR-USD = 1.10 (daily from ECB)
    ///   And USD-MXN = 17.5 (monthly from MXCB)
    ///   Then MXN-EUR = 1 / (1.10 * 17.5) = 0.05195
    ///
    /// This mixed-frequency cross-rate scenario makes refactoring challenging
    /// because the calculation logic must handle different rate frequencies.
